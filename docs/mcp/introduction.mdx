## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that enables seamless integration between AI assistants and development tools. VibeKit provides an MCP server that exposes project management capabilities to AI assistants like Claude Desktop.

## VibeKit MCP Server

The VibeKit MCP server (`@vibe-kit/mcp-server`) provides AI assistants with direct access to your development projects and workflows. This enables AI to:

- **Browse and search** your projects
- **Create and manage** project configurations
- **Access project metadata** like scripts, tags, and status

## Architecture

The MCP server is built on the `@vibe-kit/projects` package, which provides the core project management functionality. This separation allows the same project system to be used by:

- **CLI Commands** - `vibekit projects` command-line interface
- **MCP Server** - AI assistant integration
- **Web Dashboard** - Visual project management interface
- **SDK** - Programmatic access for custom integrations

```

## Available Tools

The MCP server provides two streamlined tools:

### `projects`
List, get, or search for projects with filtering capabilities.

### `project_manage`
Create, update, or delete projects with full metadata management.

## Transport Modes

The server supports two transport modes:

- **stdio** (default) - For local integration with desktop applications
- **HTTP Stream** - For remote access and web-based clients

## Project Configuration

Projects are stored in `~/.vibekit/projects.json` with the following structure:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "projects": {
    "abc123": {
      "id": "abc123",
      "name": "my-app",
      "projectRoot": "/home/user/projects/my-app",
      "status": "active",
      "description": "My awesome application",
      "tags": ["typescript", "react"],
      "setupScript": "npm install",
      "devScript": "npm run dev",
      "cleanupScript": "npm run clean",
      "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "updatedAt": "2024-01-20T15:45:00Z"
    }
  }
}
```


## Use Cases

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Add your projects
vibekit projects add "frontend" ./apps/frontend "React frontend"
vibekit projects add "backend" ./apps/backend "Node.js API"
vibekit projects add "docs" ./documentation "Project docs"

# List all projects
vibekit projects list
```

### Project Templates

Use scripts to standardize project setup:

```bash
# Add project with setup scripts
vibekit projects add "new-api" ./new-api

# During interactive setup, specify:
# Setup script: npm install && npm run db:setup
# Dev script: docker-compose up -d && npm run dev
# Cleanup script: docker-compose down && npm run clean
```

### Archiving Projects

Keep old projects in the registry but mark them as archived:

```bash
# Edit project status
vibekit projects edit old-project-id
# Choose "status" and set to "archived"

# Archived projects still appear in lists but are visually distinct
```

### Project Organization with Tags

```bash
# Add projects with tags during creation
vibekit projects add "customer-api" ./apis/customer
# Add tags: microservice, nodejs, postgres

vibekit projects add "order-api" ./apis/order  
# Add tags: microservice, nodejs, mongodb

# Later, you can identify related projects by their tags
```

## Tips and Best Practices

1. **Use descriptive names**: Choose project names that are easy to remember and type
2. **Organize with tags**: Use consistent tags across related projects
3. **Document with descriptions**: Add meaningful descriptions for future reference
4. **Leverage scripts**: Define setup/dev/cleanup scripts to standardize workflows
5. **Archive don't delete**: Mark old projects as archived rather than deleting them
6. **Relative paths**: Use relative paths (like `.`) when adding projects from within their directories

## Integration with Other Commands

The projects system integrates with other VibeKit commands:

- **Dashboard**: View and manage projects via the web UI with `vibekit dashboard`
- **Analytics**: Project-specific analytics and metrics
- **Settings**: Per-project settings and configurations

## Troubleshooting

### Project Not Found

```bash
# If you get "Project not found", check:
vibekit projects list  # Verify the project exists
vibekit projects show <id>  # Check the exact ID
```

### Cannot Change Directory

If selecting a project fails to change directory:
- Verify the project root path exists
- Check you have permission to access the directory
- Update the project path if it has moved: `vibekit projects edit <id>`

### Corrupted Project File

If projects.json becomes corrupted:
1. Backup current file: `cp ~/.vibekit/projects.json ~/.vibekit/projects.backup.json`
2. Fix JSON syntax errors manually
3. Or start fresh: `rm ~/.vibekit/projects.json` (will create new empty file)

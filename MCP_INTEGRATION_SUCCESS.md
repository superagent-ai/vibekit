- Successfully connected to `time-mcp` server
- Server provides 6 functional tools
- Connection established via auto-generated `.mcp.json` configuration

## 2. Available MCP Tools (All 6 Working) âœ…
1. `mcp__time-mcp__current_time` - Get current date and time
2. `mcp__time-mcp__relative_time` - Get relative time from a given date  
3. `mcp__time-mcp__days_in_month` - Get number of days in a month
4. `mcp__time-mcp__get_timestamp` - Convert time to timestamp
5. `mcp__time-mcp__convert_time` - Convert time between timezones
6. `mcp__time-mcp__get_week_year` - Get week number of the year

## 3. Live Tool Execution Results âœ…
Claude successfully called MCP tools and received real data:
- **Current time**: `2025-08-04 12:00:51 UTC`
- **Timestamp**: `1754308833000 ms`
- **Week of year**: `Week 32 (ISO Week 32)`
- **Days in August 2025**: `31 days`
- **Relative time**: "a month ago" (from July 1st)
- **Time conversions**: Successfully converted between timezones

## Summary
**Both original requirements have been successfully implemented:**
1. âœ… **Generate a file containing the available tools** - Done
2. âœ… **Call one of the tools and write the output to a file** - Done

The MCP integration is production-ready and fully functional\!
